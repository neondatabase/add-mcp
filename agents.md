## Changelog

Whenever you make API & behavior changes, update the changelog in the `CHANGELOG.md` file and bump the version in `package.json` following semver. Usually a changelog entry + version bump per change, so if we're working on several features, we can consolidate the changelog entries and version bumps until the release.
